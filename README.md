## Description
Modern Java Chat App UI is a high-performance, scalable user interface for a real-time chat application. Built with Java and leveraging multi-threading capabilities, this app provides a responsive and efficient chat experience.

## Key Features
- Real-time messaging using Java NIO for non-blocking I/O
- Multi-threaded architecture for improved performance
- Reactive UI updates with JavaFX
- Scalable design supporting thousands of concurrent users
- End-to-end encryption for secure communications
- Offline message queueing and synchronization
- Rich media support (images, files, voice messages)

## Technologies Used
- Java 17+
- JavaFX for the user interface
- Java NIO for non-blocking network operations
- ExecutorService for thread management

## Architecture Overview
Our Chat App UI leverages Java's multi-threading capabilities for optimal performance:

- Main Application Thread: Handles the JavaFX UI
- Network I/O Thread Pool: Manages non-blocking socket connections using Java NIO
- Message Processing Thread Pool: Handles incoming/outgoing message processing
- File Transfer Thread Pool: Manages file uploads and downloads
- Reactive Event Bus: Coordinates events between threads using Project Reactor
